      description: "Innovators at NASA's Glenn Research Center have developed a breakthrough in ion thruster technology. The Annular Ion Engine (AIE) features an annular discharge chamber with a set of annular ion optics, potentially configured with a centrally mounted neutralizer cathode assembly. Compared to current state-of-the-art, cylindrically shaped ion thrusters, the AIE includes two primary advantages: 1) it enables scaling of ion thruster technology to high power at specific impulse (Isp) desirable for near-term missions, and 2) it provides a substantial increase in both thrust density and thrust-to-power (F/P) ratio. With its additional increase in lifetime service and improvements in packaging, Glenn's AIE represents the next generation of electric propulsion systems that require higher power, F/P, and efficiency, such as Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) vehicles that may transport humans to the moon and Mars.",

      description: "Innovators at NASA Johnson Space Center have developed a coil-on-plug ignition system for integrated liquid oxygen (LOX)/liquid methane (LCH4) thermal-vacuum environment propulsion systems operating in a thermal vacuum environment. The innovation will help quell corona discharge issues and reduce overall mass. Corona discharge represents a local region surrounding a high-voltage conductor where air has undergone an electrical breakdown and become conductive due to ionization, allowing a charge to leak off the conductor and cause a possible malfunction.\n\nNASA worked with commercial vendors to modify off-the-shelf automotive coil-on-plug spark plug systems for use with LOX/LCH4 igniters. The coil-on-plug configuration eliminates the bulky standalone coil-pack and conventional high-voltage spark plug cable by combining the coil and the spark plug into a single component. The test campaign successfully proved that coil-on-plug technology can enable integrated LOX/methane propulsion systems in future spacecraft.",

Innovators at NASA's Glenn and Langley Research Centers are teaming to develop a compact, lightweight acoustic liner based on oxide/oxide ceramic matrix composite (CMC) materials. The CMC acoustic liner has variable-depth channels tuned to reduce broad-spectrum noise in subsonic jet engines. The design of those channels has also been focused on structures that minimize the overall liner thickness. Because the technology uses CMCs, rather than heavy metallic materials, it has the potential to reduce overall engine weight. The oxide/oxide CMC materials are able to withstand extremely high temperatures as well. These CMC acoustic liners can be used in many subsonic jet engines - particularly for next-generation aircraft - to reduce engine core noise. Also, because they can withstand high temperatures, core liners constructed with CMC materials can also provide a thermal barrier.",

Innovators at NASA's Glenn Research Center have developed a single pressure and temperature sensor system that provides in-situ data in harsh operating environments like combustion.  Although current SiC pressure sensors can  operate at 800Â°C inside combustion chambers,  the output response is sensitive to temperature changes and requires temperature compensation schemes that rely on a second separate temperature sensor to get a true measure of pressure. The new NASA pressure/temperature (P/T) sensor chip enables real-time translation of pressure and uses  only a single tap for two engine measurements. This important sensor system and packaging can provide more accurate data for combustion simulations and to monitor engine health to improve performance and extend the service lifetime of commercial and military aircraft, automotive engines, and power plants.",

These density changes include shock waves, vortices, engine exhaust, and wakes. The determination of location and strength of shockwaves and vortices is fundamental to understanding the flow around an aircraft. These features are strong enough to affect the environment that the vehicle inhabits: for example, they can cause drag and/or produce undesirable noise. The researcher must be able to predict and mitigate the effects of these flow features.  This invention is a robust visualization technique that will permit the measurement of the strengths and positions of shock waves caused by supersonic vehicles. The technique is applicable to all flight regimes, however, and can be used for visualizing tip vortices, engine exhaust plumes.",

The drive for energy efficiency in power generation and propulsion places the development of high-performance materials at the forefront of materials science. Turbine engine efficiency and reduction in carbon emissions are directly related to engine operating temperature. With increasing temperatures, materials start to plastically deform under load, a process known as creep, which sets severe limits on performance. Therefore, increased performance in aircraft engines and land-based power generators requires the development of new high-temperature structural materials that are resistant to creep. For example, a main factor prohibiting higher operating temperatures in jet turbine engines is the creep life of the Ni-based superalloy turbine disks. NASA's new superalloy composition significantly improves the creep life of turbine disks and also increases the operating temperature limit.",

The technology can be used as a conventional engine nacelle liner, or on the external surfaces of an aircraft to reduce acoustic scattering. As compared with conventional liners, the technology provides increased broadband acoustic performance with less drag. Conventional liners use a perforated facesheet as the outermost portion of the liner exposed to flow. The perforated facesheet has a higher drag than a smooth surface, but is necessary to reduce noise. The proposed innovation reduces the open area of the facesheet, and therefore reducing the drag of the liner, without compromising acoustic performance.",
